# Manuscript Results Replication
The `/manuscript` directory can be used to replicate results provided in the manuscript. Also included are previously recorded profiles which document the performance results for each respective combination and DEM resolution. To run, open `FullAlgorithm.m` and assign a value of `1`, `2`, or `3` to the `dem_selection` variable corresponding to the 30-meter, 10-meter, and 3-meter DEMs, respectively. Then run the script.
